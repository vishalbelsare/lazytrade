The goal of lazytrade is to keep all functions and scripts of the lazytrade educational project on [UDEMY](https://vladdsm.github.io/myblog_attempt/topics/lazy%20trading/). Functions are providing an opportunity to learn Computer and Data Science using example of Algorithmic Trading. Please kindly not that *this project was created for Educational Purposes only*! 

## Installation

You can install the released version of lazytrade from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("lazytrade")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vzhomeexperiments/lazytrade")
```
## Several ideas explored in this package

* Data manipulation and analysis of performed trades results
* Reinforcement Learning for Automated Trading Risk Management
* Data manipulation and preparation for Machine Learning (transposing, aggregation, lagging, etc)
* Using Deep Learning for prediction of Market Types (Classification)
* Using Deep Learning for prediction of future price change (Regression)
* Strategy Tests simulations
* Utility functions to generate passwords, initialization files, encryption of passwords, etc
* Explored idea of building a model using random structures combined with an automated functional (strategy) test to improve model performance
* Overall, all functions have working examples with relevant documented sample data included in the package

## Example - prepare data for machine learning

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(lazytrade)
library(magrittr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
## basic example code
# Convert a time series vector to matrix with 64 columns
macd_m <- seq(1:1000) %>% as.data.frame() %>% to_m(20)

head(macd_m, 2)
```

Why is it useful? It is possible to convert time-series data into matrix data to do make modeling

## Example - aggregate multiple log files and visualize results

Multiple log files could be joined into one data object

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(lazytrade)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(lubridate)

# files are located in the sample folders
DFOLDER <- system.file("extdata/RES", package = "lazytrade")

DFR <- opt_aggregate_results(path_data = DFOLDER)
```

This data object can be visualized

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
opt_create_graphs(x = DFR, outp_path = dir,graph_type = 'bars')
```

Or just visualize results with time-series plot

```{r}
opt_create_graphs(x = DFR, outp_path = dir,graph_type = 'ts')
```

## Example - leverage Reinforcement Learning for Risk Management

Example below would generate RL policy based on the trade results achieved so far

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ReinforcementLearning)
library(magrittr)

data(data_trades)
states <- c("tradewin", "tradeloss")
actions <- c("ON", "OFF")
control <- list(alpha = 0.7, gamma = 0.3, epsilon = 0.1)
rl_generate_policy(data_trades, states, actions, control)
```

## Example - generating passwords for trading platforms login

Multiple trading accounts require passwords, package contains function that may easily generate random passwords: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lazytrade)
library(stringr)
library(magrittr)
library(openssl)
library(readr)

#generate 8digit password for trading platform
util_generate_password(salt = 'random text')
```

## Example - generate initialization files for MT4 platform

Facilitate generation of initialisation files:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lazytrade)

dir <- normalizePath(tempdir(),winslash = "/")

# test file to launch MT4 terminal with parameters
write_ini_file(mt4_Profile = "Default",
               mt4_Login = "12345678",
               mt4_Password = "password",
               mt4_Server = "BrokerServerName",
               dss_inifilepath = dir,
               dss_inifilename = "prod_T1.ini",
               dss_mode = "prod")
```

# Notes to remind myself how to create R package

## This readme file

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

## Communicate about lifecycle changes

taken from https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/communicate.html

Run Once:

`usethis::use_lifecycle()`

To insert badge:

Add badges in documentation topics by inserting one of:

  #' `r lifecycle::badge('experimental')`
  #' `r lifecycle::badge('stable')`
  #' `r lifecycle::badge('deprecated')`


## Generating Documentation

### Title of the package
Create right title case for the title of the package
By running this command...
`tools::toTitleCase("Learn computer and data science using algorithmic trading")`
the Title will become:
"Learn Computer and Data Science using Algorithmic Trading"

### Re-generating documentation
Run this code to re-generate documentation
`devtools::document()`

### Fixing License
Run this code to fix license:
`usethis::use_mit_license(name = "Vladimir Zhbanko")`

## Adding data to the package for internal tests

Run this code to add data to the folder `data/`
`x <- sample(1000)`
`usethis::use_data(x)`

To update this data:
`x <- sample(2000)`
`usethis::use_data(x, overwrite = T)`

To convert character into time:
`mutate(across('X1', ~ as.POSIXct(.x, format = "%Y.%m.%d %H:%M:%S")))`

Note: use option 'LazyLoad` to make data available only when user wants it
always include LazyData: true in your DESCRIPTION. 
Note: to document dataset see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2310409/how-can-i-document-data-sets-with-roxygen

Document dataset using the R script `R/datasets.R` 

Use data in the function with `data(x)`

## Adding files to the package

Place data like small files to the folder:
`inst/extdata`

## Adding examples to test package function

### Tests setup first time

Run this command to setup tests
'usethis::use_testthat()'

This will create a folder with the name `tests`

Inside this folder there will be another folder `testthat`. 

### Examples in Roxygen code

@examples ...

code to execute during package checks

@examples 

/donttest{

code to NOT execute during package checks
 
}

## Testing a package

### Create a test script

Run this command to create a new script with the test skeleton:

`usethis::use_test("profit_factor.R")`

### Enrich the test script

Details:

1. add libraries used for test
2. add function `context("profit_factor")`
3. add function test_that("test description", {test process})
4. load data using function `data(named_data_object)`

Example:

```{r}
library(testthat)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)

context("profit_factor")

test_that("test value of the calculation", {

  data(profit_factor_data)

  DF_Stats <- profit_factor_data %>%
    group_by(X1) %>%
    summarise(PnL = sum(X5),
              NumTrades = n(),
              PrFact = util_profit_factor(X5)) %>%
    select(PrFact) %>%
    head(1) %>%
    pull(PrFact) %>%
    round(3)

  expect_equal(DF_Stats, 0.68)

})


```

### Test of the coverage for the script

Test coverage shows you what youâ€™ve tested
devtools::test_coverage_file()

`devtools::test_coverage_file()`

### Automated checks 

This will add automatic test coverage badge to the readme file on github
`usethis::use_coverage()`

## Checking package

Step 1. `devtools::document()`
Step 2. `devtools::run_examples()`
Step 3. Menu 'Build' `Clean and Rebuild`
Step 4. 'Check' `devtools::check()`


## Locally checking package with --run-donttest enabled 

This is now a default option

Whenever \donttest{} examples construct is used author of the package must insure that those examples are running.
Such examples are those that would require longer test execution. To perform this test package needs to be checked with the following command:

`devtools::check(run_dont_test = TRUE)`

whenever a quick check is required:

`devtools::check(run_dont_test = FALSE)` ???

## Handling functions that write files

In case functions are writing files there are few considerations to take into account:

* examples section must contain working example of code that writes files
* example code must write to the temporary directory defined by `tempdir()` function
* after package check performed with `devtools::check()` there should nothing remain in the 'tmp/' directory

### Considerations

File names defined by function `tempdir()` would look like this:
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# > tempdir()
# [1] "/tmp/RtmpkaFStZ"
```

File names defined by function `tempfile()` would look like this:
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# > tempfile()
# [1] "/tmp/RtmpkaFStZ/file7a33be992b4"
```

This is example of how function `write_csv` example works:
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
tmp <- tempfile()
write_csv(mtcars, tmp)
```
results of this code are correctly stored to the temporary file

however this example from `readr` package function `write_csv`
is showing that file will be written to the '/tmp/' directory
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
dir <- tempdir()
write_tsv(mtcars, file.path(dir, "mtcars.tsv.gz"))
```

### Deleting files after running examples:
We use function `unlink()` to do this:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
unlink("/tmp/*.csv", recursive = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

and we check that there is nothing more remained:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
dir("/tmp/*.csv")
```

### Delete deprecate functions

To remove function from the package we can use:

* Delete function from the folder (careful not to break other functions)
* Build -> More -> Document
* Build -> More -> Clean and Rebuild
* Build -> Check

## CRAN Submission Tips and Tricks

### Many notes while using global variables:

see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9439256/how-can-i-handle-r-cmd-check-no-visible-binding-for-global-variable-notes-when
see https://github.com/HughParsonage/grattan/blob/master/R/zzz.R

### Unfortunate note on specific flavors

After first submission there are some notes on specific R flavors

This question was addressed here but yet it's not answered: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48487541/r-cmd-check-note-namespace-in-imports-field-not-imported

To search for specific function in the scripts one can do the following:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

list_of_functions <- c(
  "drop_na",
  "fill",
  "extract",
  "gather",
  "nest",
  "separate"
)

for (FN in list_of_functions) {

if(!exists("res")){
 res <- BurStMisc::scriptSearch(FN)  
} else {
  res2 <- BurStMisc::scriptSearch(FN)  
  res <- mapply(c, res, res2, SIMPLIFY=FALSE)}
}


```


### Define min R version

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38686427/determine-minimum-r-version-for-all-package-dependencies

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
min_r_version <- function(package="lazytrade", exclude_main_pkg=TRUE) {

  purrr::walk(c("tools", "purrr", "devtools", "stringi", "tidyr", "dplyr"), 
              require, character.only=TRUE)

  deps <- package_dependencies(package, recursive=TRUE)

  if (exclude_main_pkg) {
    pkgs <- deps[[1]]
  } else {
    pkgs <- c(package, deps[[1]])
  }

  available.packages() %>% 
    as_data_frame() %>% 
    filter(Package %in% pkgs) %>% 
    select(Depends)  %>% 
    unlist() -> pkg_list

  # if main pkg only relied on core R packages (i.e. pkgs that aren't in CRAN) and we 
  # excluded the pkg itself from the min version calculation, this is an edge case we need
  # to handle.

  if (length(pkg_list) == 0) return("Unspecified")

  stri_split_regex(pkg_list, "[,]") %>%
    unlist() %>%
    trimws() %>%
    stri_match_all_regex(c("^R$|^R \\(.*\\)$")) %>%
    unlist() %>%
    discard(is.na(.)) %>%
    unique() %>%
    stri_replace_all_regex("[R >=\\(\\)]", "") %>%
    data_frame(vs=.) %>%
    separate(vs, c("a", "b", "c"), fill="right") %>%
    mutate(c=ifelse(is.na(c), 0, c)) %>%
    arrange(a, b, c) %>%
    tail(1) %>%
    unite(min, a:c, sep=".") -> vs

  return(vs$min)

}


# See what the min version of R shld be used
min_r_version("lazytrade") # I claim R (>= 3.0.0) in DESCRIPTION
## [1] "3.4.0"


```


### When functions are writing to the file

It's important to avoid that function write to the directory other then `tempdir()`
Construct file name must be done using `file.name()` function as follow:

```{r}
# use plane temp directory
dir_name <- normalizePath(tempdir(),winslash = "/")
file_name <- paste0('my_file', 1, '.csv')
# this needs to be used in the function
full_path <- file.path(dir_name, file_name)

# when using sub-directory
sub_dir <- file.path(dir_name, "_SUB")
if(!dir.exists(sub_dir)){dir.create(sub_dir)}

```
